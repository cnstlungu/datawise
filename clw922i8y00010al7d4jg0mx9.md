I've [previously posted](https://datawise.dev/row-level-access-security-in-bigquery) about row-level security in BigQuery.

One of the gotchas back then was the fact that you needed to manually specify what values should the access be filtered for. If only a sub-query was allowed there!

Well, a new feature, currently in preview, allows for it, even though the `CREATE ROW ACCESS POLICY` DDL reference still says it's not.

Now, one can refer to a lookup table and use that in conjunction with the SESSION\_USER function (which we've also previously looked at) to filter the values that a principal should see.

The result is the same, but this adds a degree of simplicity and easiness when managing row-level access security in BigQuery.
