Merge statements are essential for crafting incremental datasets. They let us INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE in a single command. üõ†Ô∏è  
Recently, I dived into an [insightful blog post](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/powerful-feature-on-merge-statement-in-bigquery-i-e9c805b9bc9a) about the ON FALSE clause in merge statements. Ever heard of it?

Typical merge:

```sql
MERGE table1 AS target
USING table2 AS source ON table1.column = table2.column
WHEN MATCHED -- e.g., update target
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY source -- e.g., delete from target
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY target -- e.g., insert in target
```

But with ON FALSE in the merge\_condition? [BigQuery docs](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/dml-syntax#merge_statement) call it a "constant false predicate", perfect for atomic DELETEs on the target and INSERTs from a source. Essentially, a REPLACE operation.

I tested this on some data, especially after my previous post on [Primary and Foreign Keys](https://hashnode.com/post/clmm30xg7000408mj4dot9ber). The outcomes are looking super promising.

Testing that the expected changes happened.

Using the table version that has Primary Key and Foreign Key constraints has yielded even more impressive results.
