It turns out you can now (don't know since when though) create cross-dataset foreign key relationships in BigQuery hashtag#SQL. Previously this was only possible for tables that are in the same dataset (but there were workarounds).

While the performance gain when using these *unenforced* PK/FK constraints in general may be up for discussion, it's definitely nice to be able to see this table metadata there, including the table grain üëç
