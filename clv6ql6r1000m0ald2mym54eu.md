I've posted earlier [about STRUCTS in BigQuery](https://hashnode.com/post/clv6qhpjp000208mlgvmj9305), here's how I use it from time to time to help me debug and analyze data a bit faster.

Since changing filter values for different test cases / observations you are interested about can be a headache (especially if you have a lot of columns), you could put them in a tuple of STRUCTS and check the matching records at once.

Not a game changer but makes life a bit easier üòÅ
