Does anyone have interesting use cases for the ERROR function in BigQuery?

If you like BQ errors so much that you've decided to create your own, or if you're debugging with dirty data, maybe check it out.

If will raise an error that you specify whenever executed. Plus you can also combine it with FORMAT to see what was the value that generated the issue.
