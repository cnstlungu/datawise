Whether you're an experienced data engineer or just embarking on your cloud data adventure, prioritizing security is crucial.

Here's a quick tour of BigQuery's row-level security features.

Suppose you have the following BigQuery table. Each sales representative should only have access to the data for the country they are catering to.

This service account would now only be able to see rows where the country is the US or UK.

Other users (without a Row-level access policy) would see the following:

**Deleting a Row-level access policy**

This can be done using the following commands:
