So I recently discovered the WITH expression in BigQuery SQL.

Not to be confused with the WITH clause, which we use to define common table expressions (CTEs).

ðŸ‘‰ What does a WITH expression do?  
It lets you define a series of variables, scoped to a single expression. Each variable can reference previously defined ones (and table columns), and in the end, the whole expression returns a result.

ðŸ“Œ Where could this be useful?  
Think back to the time before QUALIFY was supported. We often had to create an extra CTE just to filter with WHERE rn = 1 or for similar windowed calculations. When QUALIFY came, it saved us a bunch of boilerplate CTEs.  
Well, WITH expressions have the potential to help in the same way â€” but for non-window calculations.

When working with complex formulas, you canâ€™t reference (within the same SELECT) a column you just defined. The usual workaround is to push it into another CTE â€” which works, but feels verbose. I still opted to do it since it's important that the code stayed readable and maintainable.  
Now WITH expressions give us a cleaner option and help avoid those 7-operand expressions. I, for one, plan on trying them out ASAP.

Has anyone here used them already? Any thoughts? Docs [here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/operators#with_expression).
