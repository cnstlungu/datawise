Splitting a string in BigQuery works pretty much the same as in Excel.

`SPLIT` works in a similar way as its Excel cousin `TEXTSPLIT` - taking a string to be split and a delimiter (can be multiple characters), and returns an array of elements.

You can access them using the 0-based index or check out [my previous post](https://hashnode.com/post/clufovy9d000108l2bzv3gn9t) on more options for accessing array elements in BigQuery.
