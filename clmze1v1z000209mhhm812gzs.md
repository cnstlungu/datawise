Python users, ever needed a light data container (like a dictionary) but wanted to access members using the dot (.) notation?

There are a couple of options to choose from: namedtuple, SimpleNamespace  
and dataclass.

Here's how they all differ:

1Ô∏è‚É£ namedtuple: immutable, memory efficient, iterable and members can be accessed by index as well. Static and somewhat verbose.

2Ô∏è‚É£ simple\_namespace: mutable, uses more memory than namedtuple, not iterable nor indexable. Flexible and less verbose.

3Ô∏è‚É£ dataclass: can be mutable or not (controlled by `frozen` parameter), can set default attributes, has special methods like **repr** (how it's displayed) and **eq** (check if it's equal to another instance). Uses more memory and is relatively newly-introduced (Python 3.7).

When to use which?  
‚û° namedtuple: You need something light on memory and immutable

‚û° simple\_namespace: You need flexibility to change the attributes or even  
add them dynamically with little boilerplate.

‚û° dataclass: You want more flexibility and control.
