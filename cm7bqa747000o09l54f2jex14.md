Here’s a BigQuery trick I use all the time—seriously, not saying this to make my post catchier 😁.  
  
It’s not flashy or very complicated, but it’s one of my favorites: Job History.  
  
Under the Query Editor, you’ll find Job History, which stores all past queries—either your own (Personal History) or those run by others in the project (Project History).  
  
🔍 Why is this useful?  
  
✅ Quickly find queries you forgot to save.  
  
✅ Filter by date, SQL definition (summary), or user to track down past work.  
  
✅ For recent queries, you might even retrieve results from the temporary table—saving you from rerunning expensive queries.  
  
This has saved me so many times after accidentally closing a query tab. (Just remember: if you never executed the query, it won’t be there!)  
  
Also, please be reminded that the job data is also available via an INFORMATION SCHEMA view (check out the comments for a post about that one).
