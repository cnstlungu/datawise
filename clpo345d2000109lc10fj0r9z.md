What function do you use to explicitly de-duplicate in BigQuery?  
I normally use ROW\_NUMBER(), but I've recently encountered a really interesting [blog post](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/bigquery-admin-reference-guide-query-optimization) suggesting ARRAY\_AGG might be more performant for the task.

The explanation given is that the `ORDER BY` is allowed to drop everything except the top record on each GROUP BY, making ARRAY\_AGG more efficient.

Sure enough, I did give it a try on some sample data.

In the below example, we'd like to pick the latest date available per id. The `ROW_NUMBER` example is pretty straightforward - we partition by id and order by `ds_date` decreasingly, then use the `QUALIFY` clause to keep only the record we want.

The `ARRAY_AGG` example, while looking a bit more intimidating, does the same thing.

It turns out that the recommendation holds - slot time for the ARRAY\_AGG version was only 40% of the ROW\_NUMBER. Another day, another lesson learned.
