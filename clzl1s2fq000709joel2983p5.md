In this world, everything is ephemeral. If you need to create temporary files or directories in Python, check out the **tempfile** module.

Whether you want to store intermediate results, manage temp data during execution or just test things out, it can help you by abstracting file creation and cleaning-up operations.

In the a quick walk-through below, we're looking at the following functions:  
\- TemporaryFile : creates an anonymous temporary file  
\- NameTemporaryFile: creates a named temp file which we can use in multiple contexts  
\- TemporaryDirectory: creates a temporary directory (in which we also can create temp files).

Notice how we're using the inside context managers (the 'with' block , check out the comments for a quick intro on them). This means the file will be automatically cleaned up upon exiting (default behavior), unless we specify delete=False at creation.
