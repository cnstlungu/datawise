If you ever worked with SQL, even a tiny bit, you know NULL is very special value. Like no other. It's very different than an empty string '' or 0, rather representing the absence of a value.

A couple fun things about it:  
ðŸ”¹ you cannot test if NULL is in a list of values: NULL IN (NULL) returns a NULL  
ðŸ”¹ both (NULL = NULL) and (NULL &lt;&gt; / != NULL) are not allowed  
ðŸ”¹ COUNT(column) counts non-null occurrences in a column, whereas  
COUNT(\*) or COUNT(1) counts all rows, including those with NULLS  
ðŸ”¹ main aggregate functions ignore such SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG ignore rows with NULLS; NULL is not the smallest value, it's just NULL, but  
ðŸ”¹ ORDER by shows NULLS first by default when sorting ascending  
ðŸ”¹ since a NULL not equal (not even comparable) to another NULL, upon joining, NULL values are not going to be matched

You can handle NULLS with:  
ðŸ”¹ x IS NULL/ IS NOT NULL : checks if something is or is not a NULL  
ðŸ”¹ COALESCE: take first non-null value in a list of values  
ðŸ”¹ IFNULL/ISNULL: if null, use a backup value  
ðŸ”¹ NULLIF: replace this value with a NULL
