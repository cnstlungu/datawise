üîç What exactly are BigQuery Labels? They're key-value pairs that you can associate with different BigQuery resources like datasets, tables, views, and even jobs within a session. Consider them as 'tags' that streamline the organization, tracking, and management of your resources.

In the examples shared, we demonstrate how to label BigQuery jobs within a query and then fetch them using the INFORMATION\_SCHEMA . JOBS view.

üåü Wondering about how is it useful?

1Ô∏è‚É£ Expense Breakdown - With labels, you can categorize your BigQuery  
expenses by department, project, or any other segment, promoting clear billing.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Efficient Resource Handling - Recognize and handle resources based on their labels, facilitating a tidy and systematic workspace.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Streamlined Automation - Pair labels with Cloud Functions or other GCP tools to automate tasks based on specific labeled criteria.

If you haven't explored labels in BigQuery yet, I urge you to do so. They offer a straightforward approach to instill organization and transparency in your data workspace.

Enjoy your data exploration! üìä
