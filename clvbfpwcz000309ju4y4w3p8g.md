Growing up in post-Soviet Moldova, I was repeatedly reminded of the Chernobyl disaster. It was a topic at school, we had liquidators in our small town, and I recall the television coverage each April as the anniversary approached.

The Chernobyl disaster stands out as one of the most horrific technological failures in history. I was struck by how a technology meant for good could cause such devastation when things went wrong. This sparked my interest, leading me to delve deeper into the details. There's even an [exceptional TV miniseries](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7366338/) that captures the event.

Like many catastrophic events, Chernobyl was a result of a dark combination of factors and coincidencesâ€”design flaws, human errors, negligence, technical oversights, flawed processes, and conflicting motivations.

Conflicting motivations? Yes! Despite knowing about the reactor's design flaws, people remained silent for fear of reprisal. Construction shortcuts were taken to meet deadlines and secure bonuses.

On that fateful night of April 26th, 1986, greed likely drove some to rush safety tests for bonuses, while fear paralyzed others from challenging reckless orders.

You might wonder, why does this matter now, 40 years later? And how does it relate to software?

Consider your team or company culture. Are you incentivized to prioritize doing the right thing over meeting deadlines or earning bonuses?

Is there an environment that fosters speaking up when things are amiss? Can you take responsibility for mistakes, even if it means facing criticism?

Developing quality software is not an easy task, and aligning people's interests with the greater good is crucial.

Establishing a culture of openness and transparency, alongside appropriate incentives, should be a priority for anyone leading a team.

In life and software, mishaps occur. However, when people's motivations are aligned, we can collectively work better towards the same goal.
