I've been working for surprisingly long with SQL to have found this only a few days ago. Not long enough I guess ðŸ¤“.

I'm talking about the NULL-safe operators IS DISTINCT FROM and IS NOT DISTINCT FROM. I found about their existence from a [Linkedin post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastian-flak_the-sql-comparison-operator-you-should-activity-7322288997945212928-3hOZ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAvrnvABKPsQ1CE0m9jhBpQ-Vr-YZbN9dqg).

Works on BigQuery too, so I guess less need of adding IFNULLs / COALESCE for safety.

PS This choice of keyword "FROM", together with the one in EXTRACT(HOUR FROM DATETIME '2021-01-01'), feels pretty weird.
